## Vitali (carotid artery) project consultation (2 hr)
- When running a Pytorch script using distributed.destroy_process_group, training script hangs, possibly due to a deadlock on the GIL.
- Read through the distributed module and examples ahead of the consultation, and will be offering support as soon as Nathan can upload the code to GitHub.
- I will attempt to replicate the bug using Nathan's code, and then in a simpler setting before debugging.
- We could also offer a workshop on distributed computing in Pytorch on the HPC, as writing a small example should be easy once I'm through debugging the issue.

## Federated learning (3 hr)
- Debugged warning regarding missing fit_metrics and evaluate_metrics functions.
- Currently working on the remaining bugs.
  - The accuracy at the end of multiple is 0, indicating some error. Because we start with a pre-trained model, we should be reaching non-negligible accuracy quickly.

## PhytoOracle (13 hr)
- Learning JAX and Autograd as a tool for accelerating my Gaussian process regression code.
- I am also interested in accelerating other modules in the PhytoOracle pipeline using GPUs, as the CPU is the likely bottleneck on performance.
  - An easy target is [plant registration](https://github.com/phytooracle/3d_individual_plant_registration) as a significant portion of the computation is subtracting a constant from millions of points.
  - We can continue using Open3D as it has all of the methods already implemented using CUDA.
  - I am having issues getting Open3D to run on the HPC. My current container does not have a compiled version with the CUDA toolkit enabled. I hope to resolve this and measure the speedup on a test dataset next week.
