# Complete
- Set up the learning logs and repository
- Resetting my github to use ssh instead of keys over http, because it keeps expiring and i find that annoying
- I have also learned how to run Jupyter Notebook and Tensorboard on remote connections and serve it to local ports. Makes it easier to use computers that are more powerful than my little mac.
- Unit 2
- learning the basics of torch tensors
- review basic linear algebra
- learned about pdb for the first time
- Unit 3
- Pytorch API
- data loaders
- training a logistic regression model
- various theory about the loss function
- stochastic gradient descent
- standardization: 0-1 and z-score
-
- I need to turn in 3 ideas for my workshop by the end of the week.
- Also, I need to ask how long these workshops are supposed to be.
- possible math ideas: https://cds.nyu.edu/math-tools/
- just get a dataset and do one of the things to it
- PCA seems like a good idea. Leads into the idea of latent spaces, but later.
- CLI tools.
- MATLAB for quick linear algebra and stuff.
- homogeneous and non-homogeneous least squares.
