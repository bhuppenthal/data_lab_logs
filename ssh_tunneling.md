# SSH Tunneling Quick Explanation
[SSH Tunneling Reference](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling-example)

Connect to the server using the local port forwarding option. This tunnels connections on **port 6060** on your machine to **port 8081** of the remote machine. Now, if you navigated to port 6060 on your system, it would allow you to access port 8081 on the remote system, provided you have the access token:

```
ssh -L 6060:localhost:8081 [remote_machine]
```

Once connected to the remote machine, start Jupyter Lab (or Notebook) and provide the following flags. `--no-browser` to suppress the automatic browser Jupyter opens, and `--port` to set the specified port:

```
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8081
```

On your local machine, in the terminal where you opened Jupyter notebook, you will see the access token in the url generated by the command. Copy this.

```
Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8081/lab?token=[TOKEN]
     or http://100.0.0.1:8081/lab?token=[TOKEN]
```

Next, you can open a web browser and go to `localhost:6060` to access the running notebook instance. When the browser opens, enter the token you copied into the textbox at the top of the page.
